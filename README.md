# R01 BANK SYSTEM (atm-managment-system)

Hey guys, akhaled here<br>
This project was NOT easy, matter of fact its the biggest undertaking of my life.<br>
Yet its something i loved doing.

external libraries used:

1. `<ncurses.h>` for TUI
2. `<mysql/mysql.h>` for database API implementation

<h2>This project incorporates a mysql database, ensure you have the proper libraries and dependencies installed for it to run.</h2>
